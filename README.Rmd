## What is ranked sparsity?

The ranked sparsity methods such as the sparsity-ranked lasso (SRL) have been developed for model selection and estimation in the presence of interactions and polynomials (Peterson & Cavanaugh 2022)[https://doi.org/10.1007/s10182-021-00431-7]. The main idea is that an algorithm should be more skeptical of higher-order polynomials and interactions a priori compared to main effects, by a predetermined amount.

## Package overview

The `sparseR` package implements ranked-sparsity-based versions of the lasso, elastic net, MCP, and SCAD. We also provide a (preliminary) version of an sparsity-ranked extension to Bayesian Information Criterion (and corresponding stepwise approaches)

Additionally, `sparseR` has many features designed to streamline dealing with interaction terms and polynomials, including functions for variable pre-processing, variable selection, post-selection inference, and post-fit model visualization under ranked sparsity.

## Installation 

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}

## Via GitHub: 
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("petersonR/sparseR")

# or via CRAN
install.packages("sparseR")
```

## Example

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(sparseR)
```

```{r example}
data(iris)
set.seed(1321)

srl <- sparseR(Sepal.Width ~ ., data = iris, k = 1, seed = 1)
srl
```
